            <p>Beasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.</p>

            <p>Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest sensefrightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owl bears), and others ,are the product-of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.</p>

            <p>Oozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.</p>

            <p>Plants in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Humanoids are the main peoples of the D&amp;D world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (golblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds. A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book, but the races detailed in the Player's Handbook- with the exception of drow-are dealt with in appendix B. That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that you·can use to make various members of those races.</p>

            <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
            <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

            <p>At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.</p>
            <p class="indent">Within 8 hours of word and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call faorth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select your companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, you DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you use this ability to return a former animal to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.</p>
            <h5>COMPANION'S BOND</h5>
            <p>Your aninmal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.</p>
            <p class="indent">The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.</p>
            <p class="indent">The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. An animal companion add its proficiency bonus to AC, skills, saving throws, attack bonus, and damage rolls.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.</p>
            <p class="indent">For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.</p>
            <p class="indent">When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom i would gladly give my life".</p>
